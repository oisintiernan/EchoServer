# EchoServer
Connects to echo server, allows one to send messages which are echoed back in capitals.
The program will ask you what word you want in capitals, enter a word and then the server will send back word in capitals.
The program loops and asks you if you would like to enter a word again, type "q" to exit the program.
It is set up to send to localhost port:8000 but if you wish to send a word to the server which Prof. Barret made comment lines 12 and 15 and uncomment lines 13 and 16. This will direct the message at the required server.
